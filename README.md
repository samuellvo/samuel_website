# Welcome! This is a new side-project.
I'm rebuilding my website (seen in a separate, also public repository). 
That initial repository was really for getting the rope of things as I was teaching myself HTML/CSS/JS with online materials.

Then, I used my student developer email to get GitHub Pages with Pro, and I went to a registrar to lease a domain name, configured the domain, and configured the CNAME in that repo so I'd have a neat, functional website.

The plan is to make this repo the new page as I have remodularized everything, as previously, it really wasn't built for longevity. This time, it will be, and with cleaner and more modern methods rather than just the bare-bones. NPM will allow me to do cooler stuff, if I so choose, as well.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
